## HackYourPhD 

I cofounded [HackYourPhD](hackyourphd.org) an Open Science community in january 2013 with [Guillaume Dumas](http://www.extrospection.eu/) researcher in Neuroscience. 
HackYourPhD became a non-profit organization (association loi 1901) in August 2014.



###What are our missions?
 
HackYourPhD :
- shares **news about Open Science** through a collective daily curation on social networks in both French and English ([Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/499463776745202/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hackyourphd)
- organizes **events** in France; especially workshops about targeted topics or introductions and debates about Open Science (cf. our events page in [French](http://hackyourphd.org/evenements/) and in [English](http://hackyourphd.org/en/event/)).￼￼￼￼
- produces **contents** to help researchers and students to understand what is Open Science and how they can participate. HackYourPhD blog contains various articles but also creative format to communicate about Open Science (e.g. [flyers](http://hackyourphd.org/en/flyers/))

With HackYourPhD, I did an Open Science tour across the USA during the Summer 2013 to meet the key Open Science actors and gather information about the roots of the movement. This project [HackYourPhD aux States](http://hackyourphd-aux-states.strikingly.com/) was successfully funded by crowd funding. All the resources, interviews, travel log are openly available on our website.￼We are connected with other organizations: Mozilla Science Lab, Software Carpentry, Open Knowledge Foundation, Right to Research.
